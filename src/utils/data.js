        question: 'What is Star?',
        answer:
          'A star is an astronomical object consisting of a luminous spheroid of plasma held together by its own gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun.'

        question: 'What is a Supernova?',
        answer:
          'A supernova is the biggest explosion that humans have ever seen. Each blast is the extremely bright, super-powerful explosion of a star.'

      {
        question: 'How does a black hole form?',
        answer:
          "A black hole can be formed by the death of a massive star. When such a star has exhausted the internal thermonuclear fuels in its core at the end of its life, the core becomes unstable and gravitationally collapses inward upon itself, and the star's outer layers are blown away."

        question: 'What is Dark Matter?',
        answer:
          "Dark matter is a form of matter thought to account for approximately 85% of the matter in the universe. It's called dark because it does not appear to interact with the electromagnetic field, which means it does not absorb, reflect or emit electromagnetic radiation, and is therefore difficult to detect."

        question:
          'Without a containing medium, if a feather and a bar of steel are in Free Fall, which of them hits the ground first?',

          'They both hit the ground at the same time! Gravity is independant of mass.'
